# Tata-Group-AI-Collections-Simulation

🚀 **Completed as part of the Tata Group Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage – June 2025**

This project simulates real-world AI analytics work for Tata iQ's Financial Services team, focused on designing a responsible, scalable, and regulation-aligned collections strategy using agentic AI and predictive modeling.

## 📌 Project Overview

This simulation involved designing an AI-powered collections system for a financial services company (Geldium), with the goal of improving collections outcomes through data-driven insights and ethical automation.

**Key Objectives:**
- Analyze and structure customer data to identify delinquency risk.
- Design a no-code predictive modeling framework using GenAI tools.
- Develop a high-level AI system strategy that aligns with financial regulations.
- Build an executive-facing PowerPoint deck outlining how the system works, guardrails, and impact.

## 📊 Key Deliverables

### 1. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified trends, data quality issues, and early risk signals using GenAI prompts.
- Structured insights to support feature selection and model logic.

### 2. 🧠 Predictive Modeling Framework
- Proposed a no-code model approach to assess customer delinquency.
- Included logic structure, feature use, decision criteria, and model evaluation.

### 3. 🤖 AI-Powered Collections System Design
- Developed a concept for an autonomous collections system using agentic AI.
- Outlined the system’s:
  - **Inputs** (e.g., credit utilization, demographics)
  - **Decision logic** (rules + model predictions)
  - **Actions** (reminders, hardship offers, escalations)
  - **Learning loop** (feedback-based refinement)

### 4. 🛡️ Responsible AI Guardrails
- Ensured regulatory alignment with:
  - **ECOA (US)** — Fair lending
  - **GDPR (EU/UK)** — Data transparency and explanation
  - **FCA (UK)** — Ethical treatment in collections
- Embedded fairness, explainability, human oversight, and audit readiness.

### 5. 📈 Business Impact
- **Quantitative Outcomes**: Increased repayment, reduced delinquency, cost efficiency.
- **Qualitative Outcomes**: Improved customer trust, fairness, regulatory confidence.
